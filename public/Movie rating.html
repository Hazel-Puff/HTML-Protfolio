<h2> Best Series According to Adegboyega</h2>
<hr/> 
    <h3>One Peice</h3>
    <p>In my opinion one of the most interesting animes I have ever watched.It is about a young man who has made this promise to himself that he will become the King of the pirates-He shouts that all the time, making his intentions known to his comrades and all the  other pirates on the sea. Although the other pirates laugh at him he does not relatent because he has a goal and he is going to get there at all cost.

    <h3> Suits</h3>
    <p>This is another great series to watch. I remember starting it and I was hooked from the very beginning. It is a show about a man called Micheal Ross who was expelled because of a silly mistakeHe made of copying the test questions and selling the answers to the daughter of the dean. He later finds himself in an interview for a post he was not qualified for and he got the job. The story is filled with so much action, drama, emotions and plot twists aswell... a must watch for anyone who loves series. </p>
<h4>I know I said 3 but to be honest I do not rate any other series, Anime on the other hand...</h4>
<h3> Naruto and Naruto Shippuden</h3>
<p> This a story based on parental sacrifice and the joys of having people around to encourage and care for you. His parents died protecting the town that they lived in from the vicious nine-tailed fox, before his parents died they sealed a part of the demon fox in there son and entrusted him to the current head of the town. He grows up to be a niusance and everyone in the small town hated him. The reason he is that way is because he is alone and is seeking the attention of the people around him. He eventually finds friends in the ninja school which is important to go to if you want to become an Hokage which was his goal. Unknowing to him he was following in his fathers footsteps. He is met with many adversities on his road to Hokage and this help make him into the man you know and love in Naruto. This series is a bit similar to One piece</p>
